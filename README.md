# Uifry Landing Page

This is a Finance app landing page created as an internship task. The project is built using Next JS and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): The JavaScript runtime environment.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): Package managers for Node.js.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaurangsaini01/uifry.git
```

Install Dependencies using
```bash
npm install 
```
or
```bash
npm i
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/local` to automatically optimize and load `Clash Display`, a custom downloaded Font.

## Technologies used -

* **Next JS :-**
Leverages the familiarity and power of React, making development efficient for those already comfortable with the framework.

Provides features like data fetching, image optimization, and more, reducing boilerplate code and development time.

* **Tailwind CSS :-**

Eliminates the need for writing extensive custom CSS or managing separate CSS files, significantly speeding up development process

Tailwind CSS offers responsive utility classes for various screen sizes (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:) that allow you to easily control how elements behave on different devices. This is crucial for ensuring the **Landing Page** looks great and functions well across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
